# openweather-API
School assignment of how to use JSON and extract data from openweather.org
NOTE: API key from OpenWeather is missing, because I took it away from the code. Get a specific API key from openweathermap.org

Original assignment:
- parse the JSON data and output it to div.
- implement an onchange-event on the pulldown menu, which will allow the user to select which city's data will be shown from a list of cities.
- add functionality to an input field, in which the user can write search queries which are sent to the OpenWeatherMap API and the system will run a search query which is returned to your app.

TODO
- The data presentation is very simple, add more style to it by editing the table content

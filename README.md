# openweather-API
School assignment of how to use JSON and extract data from openweather.org

Original assignment:
- When you achieve this, then parse the data and output it to div.
- When you have achieved this, implement an onchange-event on the pulldown menu, which will allow the user to select which city's data will be shown from a list of cities.
- When you have completed this, add functionality to an input field, in which the user can write search queries which are sent to the OpenWeatherMap API and the system will run a search query which is retuned to your app.

NOTE: API key from OpenWeather is missing, because I took it away from the code. Get a specific API key from openweathermap.org
